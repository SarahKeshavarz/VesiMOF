These shell scripts help in preparing the input files for DFT calculations by the Gaussian package, and then configurational sampling. 
Step 1 uses a general description of a metal node structure (from a series of metal-organic frameworks) and replaces its generic "Me" metal atoms with the metal atom of choice. 
To consider all potential spin states, Step 2, uses the data about the number of unpaired electrons (see the *.txt file) and generates the input files for optimization and frequency calculations on the metal node structures at various spin states. 
The most important results can be extracted in Step 3 to see what spin state is stable (with no imaginary frequency), lowest in energy and without spin contamination. That spin state, would be the ground spin state for that metal node. 
In Step 4, the Gaussian input files can be prepared for a large number of organic ligand structures. 
Step 5, pulls the coordinates and partial atomic charges of the optimized structures from the Gaussian *.log files, assigns forcefield parameters to the atoms and generates the input files needed for configurational sampling by the ABCluster program. Note that, the credit of the main script, in Step 5, goes to Jakub Kubechka (https://github.com/kubeckaj/JKCS). The code is modified to assign correct UFF4MOF force field parameters and extract APT charges.
